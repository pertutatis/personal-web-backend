# Active Context

## Current Focus
Draft Mode for Articles - Implementation of draft/published status functionality with TDD approach.

## Recent Changes
1. Created ADR-017: Draft mode architectural decisions 
2. Created OBR-006: Business rules for draft mode functionality
3. Defined status states: DRAFT (default) and PUBLISHED
4. Planned unidirectional transition: DRAFT ‚Üí PUBLISHED only

## Active Development
### Draft Mode Implementation
- ‚úÖ Documentation completed (ADR-017 and OBR-006)
- üîÑ TDD implementation phase started
- ‚è≥ ArticleStatus value object implementation
- ‚è≥ Article entity status transitions
- ‚è≥ Database migration for status column
- ‚è≥ Repository filtering by status
- ‚è≥ API endpoint updates

### Architectural Decisions
- ADR-017: Defines draft mode architecture and implementation approach
- OBR-006: Establishes business rules and test scenarios
- Maintaining hexagonal architecture principles
- Following TDD methodology throughout implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement ArticleStatus value object with TDD
2. Update Article entity with status transitions
3. Create database migration for status column
4. Update repositories to filter by status
5. Modify API endpoints for draft/publish workflows
6. Add comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, e2e)

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Implement status validation at domain level
- Ensure blog endpoints only show published articles
- Add proper database indexes for status filtering
- Follow TDD methodology throughout implementation

## Current Challenges
1. Implementing status transitions without breaking existing functionality
2. Ensuring proper validation for status changes
3. Maintaining API backward compatibility
4. Comprehensive test coverage across all layers

## Documentation Status
- ‚úÖ ADR-017 completed and reviewed
- ‚úÖ OBR-006 completed and reviewed
- ‚è≥ Implementation documentation pending
- ‚è≥ API documentation updates pending
- ‚è≥ OpenAPI schema updates pending
